### Hi there 👋
I am a **dedicated computer science student** at Babeș-Bolyai University with a deep passion for software development, particularly in areas such as web development. My extensive knowledge spans languages like **Java, C, C++, Python, and Assembly**, as well as familiarity with technologies such as **SQL, CSS, and React**. Through volunteering experiences, I've honed my skills and discovered my unique approach to **teamwork**, thriving even in large collaborative environments. I believe my strong **problem-solving abilities**, coupled with **attention to detail**, have been a real help for the success of the team-based projects that I worked on. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to organizational growth while continually **expanding my own skills and knowledge**.
